    "Init1": "Marodyne LiV is a third generation low-intensity vibration device that safely improves muscle strength¹, function², and circulation³.",
    "Init2": "The device builds on technology resulting from over 30 years of basic and clinical research, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other funding agencies around the world.",
    "Init3": "Conditions such as rebuilding muscle mass, restoring joints, adjunctive treatment for obesity, relieving minor pain or treating a temporary increase in local circulation may be safely overcome using Marodyne LiV for 10 - 20 minutes a day.",

    "Device1": "An astronaut will suffer deconditioning of their musculoskeletal system while in a zero-gravity environment. This is analogous to aging hereon earth.",
    "Device2": "To mitigate the astronaut’s muscle and bone loss while in space, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) put together a team, led by Professor Clinton Rubin, to research and develop the low-intensity vibration concept.",
    "Research & science supports Marodyne LiV": "Research & science supports Marodyne LiV",
    "Science1": "The Low-intensity Vibration is high frequency, low-magnitude acceleration of the human standing on the device that contributes to bone and muscle wellness. These low magnitude accelerations also promote the building of lean muscle mass and the conditioning of muscle reflexes.",
    "The Marodyne LiV device draws on a solid medical foundation.": "The Marodyne LiV device draws on a solid medical foundation.",
    "Medical1": "The starting points for the development of the treatment were orthopedics, osteoporosis and space medicine. The future of the research is increasingly determined by new studies into musculoskeletal health and effect of these low magnitude vibratory forces.",
    "Know who is behind the Marodyne LiV:": "Know who is behind the Marodyne LiV:",
    "Medical2": "Clinton T. Rubin, is Chief Scientific Officer at BTT Health GmbH that manufactures Marodyne LiV devices. He is SUNY Distinguished Professor and Director of the Center for Biotechnology, Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory. He has spent his scientific career trying to understand how mechanical signals influence the body. One of his key findings has been that extremely low magnitude mechanical signals, delivered in the form of Low-intensity Vibration (LiV), can dictate the regeneration patterns of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) found within the body to stimulate musculoskeletal tissues and suppress the formation of fat¹.",
